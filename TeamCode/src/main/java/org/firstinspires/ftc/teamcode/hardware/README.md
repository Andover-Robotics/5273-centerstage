This folder contains the hardware classes and interfaces for the robot. Each hardware component will have its own "Real" class, "Sim" class and interface.
Right now the sim classes are not created yet, but they will be soon.
The Real classes are created but their methods are not implemented yet. They will be implemented soon.
The interfaces should only contain methods that are directly related to the hardware component API, no processing or calculations should be done in the interface.
